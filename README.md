### Car Price Prediction with Linear Regression. 
The aim is to develop models based on our data to predict car prices using machine learning algorithms. We would like to know:
- Which variables are significant in predicting a car's price?
- How well those variables describe the price of a car?

### Our Achieved Result
 1- Linear Rgression
 - MSE Test Score 0.012
 
 2- Lasso Regularization
 - Before Feature Selection: MSE Test Score 0.012
 - After Feature Selection: MSE Test Score 0.011
 
 3- Ridge Regularization 
 - MSE Test Score 0.012

Our Selected Model with the best MSE Test Score is <strong> Lasso Regularization </strong> after Feature Selection with MSE Test Score <strong> 0.011</strong>
